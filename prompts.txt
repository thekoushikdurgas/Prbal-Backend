so in-app 'prbal' there are 4 tabs
1. The dashboard tab designed like it every reads unread SMS and tracks all Transaction and updated the exist statement it add then shows in dashboard see in progress bar and when new Transactions are added statement it has two buttons yes or no
2. also add a tab to show all SMS in mobile and all SMS are converted to Transactions tracks all statement see in progress bar and when new Transactions add in statement it two buttons yes or no also read SMS in mobile to read credit or debit details to read salary also read every day spends every where and saved every spend saved in mongodb by Ai in refractor flutter that named 'prbal'  and mantained the file readme.md also read SMS in mobile to read credit or debit details analysis by AI openrouter model to read salary also read every day spends everywhere and saved every spend saved in mongodb


To integrate OpenRouter's free models into your flutter app "prbal" and add a dropdown for selecting free models in the settings page, follow this implementation plan using the provided knowledge base:

---

### 1. Fetch Free Models from OpenRouter API
Use the OpenRouter `/models` endpoint to list all models and filter for free ones [[2]][[8]]:  
```javascript
// services/openrouter.js
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';


export async function fetchFreeModels() {
  try {
    const response = await openai.models.list(); // GET /models [[2]]
    // Filter free models (e.g., those with ":free" suffix or price=0)
    return response.data.filter(model => 
      model.id.includes(':free') || model.pricing?.input === 0
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch models:", error);
    return [];
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Settings Page UI with Model Dropdown
Create a `SettingsScreen` with a dropdown to select models using `react-native-dropdown-picker` [[6]]:  
```javascript
// screens/SettingsScreen.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import DropDownPicker from 'react-native-dropdown-picker';
import { fetchFreeModels } from '../services/openrouter';

const SettingsScreen = () => {
  const [models, setModels] = useState([]);
  const [selectedModel, setSelectedModel] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch and format models on load
    fetchFreeModels().then(fetchedModels => {
      setModels(fetchedModels.map(model => ({
        label: model.name || model.id,
        value: model.id,
      })));
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Select Free Model:</Text>
      <DropDownPicker
        items={models}
        value={selectedModel}
        onChangeItem={item => setSelectedModel(item.value)}
        placeholder="Choose a model"
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default SettingsScreen;
```

---

### 3. Use Selected Model in AI Requests
Pass the selected model ID to your AI service [[1]][[5]]:  
```javascript
// services/ai.js
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';


export async function getAIResponse(prompt, selectedModel) {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: selectedModel, // Use the user-selected model
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
  });
  return completion.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

---

### 4. Key Implementation Notes
- Free Model Filtering:  
  OpenRouter labels free models with suffixes like `:free` (e.g., `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05:free`) [[7]][[8]].  
- Error Handling:  
  Add loading states and error messages for network failures [[9]].  
- Persistent Storage:  
  Save the selected model to `AsyncStorage` to persist user preferences [[4]].  

---

### 5. durgas Workflow
1. Settings Page: User selects a free model (e.g., `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite`).  
2. AI Interaction: The selected model is used for all chat/completion requests [[5]][[6]].  

By integrating this dropdown, "prbal" users can dynamically choose free OpenRouter models for budgeting insights while minimizing costs.
3. also, add a tab to show calendar to show how daily and monthly total spending and how much to spend exits or when it is good to give me suggestions by ai by r reading by spends by Ai in refractor flutter that named 'prbal'  and maintained the file 
4.  for the settings tab

yes go ahead ilike your plan can you continue your work

# Comprehensive Screen Analysis of prbal App

design Authentication screens with common color theme or palate and a common components darts  or any common  data in modern UI/UX style

# Model Architecture Update Plan

## Overview
We're upgrading all data models in the prbal app to use both json_serializable and Hive for better code maintenance and offline capability.

## Changes Made
1. ServiceModel - Updated with json_serializable and Hive annotations
2. BookingModel - Updated with json_serializable and Hive annotations
3. BidModel - Updated with json_serializable and Hive annotations
4. NotificationModel - Updated with json_serializable and Hive annotations

## Next Steps
1. Run the code generation to create all .g.dart files:
   ```
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```
   or use the provided helper scripts:
   - `./generate_models.sh` on Linux/Mac
   - `generate_models.bat` on Windows

2. Update remaining models:
   - review_model.dart
   - product_model.dart
   - ai_suggestion_model.dart
   - Any other models in the app

3. Update HiveService for all new models:
   - Make sure TypeIDs continue in sequence
   - Register all adapters
   - Open all boxes

4. Update services to use Hive for local caching:
   - Update FirebaseService to cache data to Hive
   - Add offline capability to critical services
   - Add data sync mechanisms

5. Update UI to handle offline state:
   - Create helper for data source (network vs cache)
   - Add UI indicators for offline mode
   - Implement optimistic updates

## Hive TypeID Registry
Keep track of all type IDs to avoid conflicts:
- 0: UserModel
- 1: UserType (enum)
- 2: BookingStatus (enum)
- 3: BookingModel
- 4: BidModel
- 5: ServiceModel
- 6: NotificationType (enum)
- 7: NotificationModel

Next available ID: 8
